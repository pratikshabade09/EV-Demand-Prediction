# ⚡ EV Charging Station Demand Predictor

Welcome to the EV Charging Demand Predictor — an interactive web app that estimates the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations needed for a region based on its population and EV density.

## 📌 Project Overview

🚗 With the rise of electric vehicles, it's crucial to forecast infrastructure needs.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict EV charging station demand based on:

- Population Density (per sq.km)
- EV Vehicle Density (per sq.km)

The model was trained using real-world data from U.S. alternative fuel station listings and simulated demographics.
